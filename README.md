# vamp-on-azure

Ideas for things to include

* Intro to VAMP and key features (canary release, microscaling, ...?)
* How to install VAMP on ACS
  * link to installing ACS
  * How to install VAMP
    * This varies by orchestrator. Should we pick one, or cover them all?
* How to perform canary release/microscaling
  * Should this be on ACOM, or links to vamp.io?


Other thoughts: if we have any artefacts used in the process (scripts, configs, ...) where should we host them? A vamp repo, an MS repo, ...?
